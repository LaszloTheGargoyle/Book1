# Welcome to Laszlo's Book One Repo

ISBN: 9798215746196 - These are my assets, notes, concept items, and custom artwork for Laszlo starting at 2013 and ending Oct 31, 2023

## What's all this about?

That's a good question. This is a living repo for the assets for my first Laszlo, the Gargoyle book. I will be adding incrementally as I organize them. Some are pictures I pulled from around the internet to help me construct a vision for the characters in my book. The book has evolved dramatically since I first wrote it. I'm not even that person anymore, and 10 years on this planet is a long time ago and a different world entirely. Some parts of this book needed to be recovered from memory. Roughly 20 percent of my original manuscript was caught in a hard drive failure. Painfully missing in its original state, I cobbled those parts back together from memory. For example, in the novel, a part that went missing was my 1956 Hungarian revolution scene in Laszlo the Gargoyle was, unfortunately, part of that catastrophe. My first cut of that scene was perfect in my eyes. It flowed well with the overarching story of Laszlo's early days. I rewrote that scene repeatedly over the last several years, but never to that initial intensity. 

- The rest of the raw book (will be) captured here. 
- The book is finally finished.

## Any advice for another writer?

Well, let's see. You have to love to write. I do love to write. I always wanted to be a writer since I was a teenager. I had delusions of grandeur, visions of me in a fun part of town listening to the Beatles song 'Here Comes the Sun' and wordsmith thought-provoking prose and poetry. Although how it actually played out was much different. I spent 10 years writing a fiction book, shelving it many times. But why fiction!? Fiction is such a tricky genre to break into. My non-fiction books, if I dare to call them that, sell (some), but my fiction books don't sell very well. Books like: Statue, Frog, Space Station Moon, Fanny & Carl. I won't sugarcoat it; they were outright failures.

There are lots of reasons for this. First, writing fiction means writing something you love and tossing it into a volcano packed with great stories, some of which will never see the light of day or find that particular reader that would directly connect solid greed on all circuits with your stories. Also, fiction stories are so hard to control. You want to pack everything, EVERYTHING, in the first pass, which leads to significant problems later when you have to resolve all those beautiful ideas that made so much sense early on in your story. I tried different things ten years ago to get my story sorted out. Some worked, and some didn't. Beyond that, life doesn't let you just linearly do things. You have to share space with reality, like making money to pay bills, finding your career footing, and working through and with your family at many stages of change. The ups and more impressive cascading failures, slow repairs, and minor corrections come after slowing down your spiraling descent and the hard work to contain the damage that was intentional or accidental by your hands or by the people and environment around you. To gain footing and crawl back out again. Life is not always a fantastic experience, but I do know about people and myself that there is always a way through understanding, luck, chance, synchronicity, fortune, or a combination of things. It's important to acknowledge those moments and try not to shut them out. Sometimes surrounding yourself with better like-people and environments conducive to success is the way to go.

I'm a believer in myself. You should believe in yourself and your capability to communicate your story effectively. 
I'm not beyond my silly superstitions, and if there is one thing I can offer you, my dear reader, it's this. There is no such thing in my mind as 'life's purpose', only 'mastering and improving your routines'. Writing is a routine. 
Keep your goals achievable. For example, I attempt to type 4-10 pages a day. Ten pages equal a chapter, and that's huge! I also accept my struggle spots in writing. Examples are plotholes in my story. They abound! I also know my character development is shallow, I wish I was better at it, but it always feels like it gets in the way of the story.

Conversely, my action sequences are dense and informationally intense in compositions. It's my saving grace as a writer.

We all have the good and bad as writers in every book. Stick to what you do best in your storytelling. Most importantly, when you lay down an initial story, understand that your story will not be a great first pass. You will need to rewrite it and rewrite it again (and again). But, rewriting becomes the most enjoyable part of the writing process. 

Don't give up. And remember, sometimes getting the story the way you want can take time, sometimes 10 years.

## Where can I find the book?

Good question. It's currently under review, and from the date of my publishing this repo, we are eight months away from its release date (Halloween 2023). The manuscript may change some, but only a little...only if there are glaring mistakes. I plan to add 24 to 50 rich pieces of artwork to enhance the novel and help with the subcontext of specific items, persons, or places of interest in the book. The artwork so far is being created by two individuals who are commissioned: If you like their work, you can find and **connect to both here:**
